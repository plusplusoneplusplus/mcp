## Core Features

### 1. Universal AI Agent Pattern Detection
- **Cursor Agent Patterns**:
  - "I've reached my tool call limit of 25"
  - "I need to pause execution"
  - "Would you like me to continue?"
  - "I'll need to continue in the next message"

- **Windsurf Agent Patterns**:
  - "I need to pause here due to limitations"
  - "Shall I continue with the next steps?"
  - "I've hit the execution limit"

- **Generic AI Assistant Patterns**:
  - "To proceed with the remaining"
  - "Continue with the implementation?"
  - "Should I proceed?"
  - "Let me know if you'd like me to continue"

### 2. Smart Response System
- **Context-Aware Responses**:
  - "continue" for simple continuation requests
  - "Yes, please continue" for question-style prompts
  - "proceed" for formal continuation requests
  - Custom responses based on detected context

### 3. Configuration Management
- **User Settings**:
  - Enable/disable functionality
  - Custom trigger patterns
  - Response templates
  - Check interval timing
  - Logging preferences

### 4. Advanced Features
- **Pattern Learning**: Detect new patterns based on user behavior
- **Response Customization**: Allow users to define custom responses
- **Activity Logging**: Optional logging for debugging and analytics
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Quick toggle and manual trigger options

## Implementation Details

### Extension Activation
- Activate on startup for all file types
- Monitor active editor content changes
- Lightweight polling mechanism (500ms default)

### Pattern Detection Algorithm
1. **Text Change Detection**: Monitor editor content for changes
2. **Pattern Matching**: Use regex patterns to detect trigger phrases
3. **Context Analysis**: Analyze surrounding text for better accuracy
4. **False Positive Prevention**: Avoid triggering on user-written text

### Response Mechanism
1. **Pattern Identification**: Determine which pattern was matched
2. **Response Selection**: Choose appropriate response based on pattern
3. **Text Replacement**: Replace trigger text with response
4. **Cursor Positioning**: Maintain proper cursor position after replacement

### Configuration Schema
```json
{
  "aiAutoContinue.enabled": true,
  "aiAutoContinue.checkInterval": 500,
  "aiAutoContinue.triggerPatterns": {
    "toolCallLimit": {
      "pattern": "I've reached my tool call limit",
      "response": "continue",
      "enabled": true
    },
    "pauseExecution": {
      "pattern": "I need to pause execution",
      "response": "continue",
      "enabled": true
    }
  },
  "aiAutoContinue.customTriggers": {},
  "aiAutoContinue.logActivity": false
}
```
