No workspace is currently open. To get started with development assistance:

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Open a folder** in VS Code containing your project
2. **Open files** you want to work with
3. **Select code** for specific analysis

## 💡 What I Can Help With
- **Project Structure Analysis** - Understand your codebase organization
- **Code Quality Review** - Identify improvements and best practices
- **Debugging Support** - Help solve issues and errors
- **Performance Optimization** - Find bottlenecks and efficiency gains
