# Performance Test Prompt

This is a large prompt file designed to test the metadata parser's performance with substantial content.

## Large Content Section

${'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. '.repeat(100)}

## Parameters

The following parameters are available:
- {{iterations}}: Controls the number of test iterations
- {{batchSize}}: Sets the processing batch size
- {{verbose}}: Enables detailed output logging

## Performance Characteristics

This prompt tests several aspects of the parser:

1. **Memory Usage**: Large content blocks to test memory efficiency
2. **Parsing Speed**: Complex frontmatter with many fields
3. **Validation Performance**: Multiple parameters and examples
4. **Cache Efficiency**: Repeated access patterns

${'## Repeated Section\n\nThis section is repeated to increase file size and test parser performance with large files.\n\n'.repeat(50)}

## Conclusion

This prompt should successfully parse while demonstrating the parser's ability to handle larger files efficiently.
