# Prompt Store & Agent Panel Integration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for integrating the Wu Wei prompt store with the agent panel, following wu wei principles of natural flow and minimal friction. The integration will enable agents to leverage structured prompts with variable substitution while maintaining clean separation of concerns.

## Architecture Vision

### Core Design Principle
Move prompt management into a dedicated shared module that both the prompt store UI and agent panel can use, avoiding tight coupling while enabling seamless prompt-to-agent workflows.

### Key Benefits
- **Unified Prompt Management**: Single source of truth for all prompt operations
- **Enhanced Agent Capabilities**: Agents can leverage structured prompts with variables
- **Improved User Experience**: Seamless flow from prompt selection to agent execution
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy addition of new prompt-aware features
- **Wu Wei Compliance**: Natural, effortless user interactions

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Shared Prompt Service Foundation
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks  
**Focus**: Create the core shared prompt management infrastructure

**Deliverables**:
- Shared `PromptService` interface and implementation
- Common types and utilities for prompt operations
- Service factory for dependency injection
- Unit tests for core functionality

**Dependencies**: None  
**Risk Level**: Low

### Phase 2: PromptManager Refactoring
**Timeline**: 1 week  
**Focus**: Refactor existing PromptManager to implement shared service interface

**Deliverables**:
- Refactored `PromptManager` implementing `PromptService`
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Integration tests with existing prompt store
- Migration validation

**Dependencies**: Phase 1 complete  
**Risk Level**: Medium (existing functionality changes)

### Phase 3: Prompt Store Migration
**Timeline**: 1 week  
**Focus**: Update prompt store to use the shared service

**Deliverables**:
- Updated `PromptStoreProvider` using shared service
- Verified existing functionality unchanged
- Performance optimization
- User acceptance testing

**Dependencies**: Phase 2 complete  
**Risk Level**: Low

### Phase 4: Agent Panel Enhancement
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks  
**Focus**: Add prompt selection and integration capabilities to agent panel

**Deliverables**:
- Enhanced agent panel UI with prompt selection
- Variable input forms and prompt preview
- Updated webview communication protocol
- Agent request processing with prompt context

**Dependencies**: Phase 3 complete  
**Risk Level**: Medium (new UI complexity)

### Phase 5: Prompt-Aware Agents
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks  
**Focus**: Enhance existing agents to support prompt integration

**Deliverables**:
- Enhanced `GitHubCopilotAgent` with prompt support
- Updated agent capabilities interface
- Example prompt templates for common agent tasks
- Documentation and user guides

**Dependencies**: Phase 4 complete  
**Risk Level**: Low

## Success Criteria

### Technical Goals
- [ ] Zero breaking changes to existing prompt store functionality
- [ ] Agent panel can select and use prompts with <200ms latency
- [ ] Variable substitution works reliably for all prompt types
- [ ] Memory usage increase <10MB for new functionality
- [ ] Test coverage >90% for new shared components

### User Experience Goals
- [ ] Users can select prompts in agent panel within 3 clicks
- [ ] Prompt variable forms are intuitive and validated
- [ ] Seamless flow from prompt selection to agent execution
- [ ] Clear feedback for prompt rendering and validation errors
- [ ] Consistent experience across prompt store and agent panel

### Integration Goals
- [ ] All existing agents work without modification
- [ ] New prompt-aware capabilities are opt-in
- [ ] Configuration reuses existing prompt store settings
- [ ] Performance impact on non-prompt workflows is negligible

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Breaking Changes**: Maintain strict backward compatibility through interface design
2. **Performance Impact**: Implement lazy loading and caching strategies
3. **Complexity Growth**: Keep interfaces simple and well-documented
4. **Memory Leaks**: Proper disposal patterns for all event subscriptions

### User Experience Risks
1. **UI Complexity**: Progressive disclosure of advanced features
2. **Learning Curve**: Comprehensive documentation and examples
3. **Feature Discovery**: Clear visual indicators for prompt-enabled agents
