# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enhance the existing dataframe service module by adding a comprehensive web interface that provides visibility into stored DataFrames and enables interactive manipulation through a user-friendly dashboard. The web interface will integrate with the existing MCP server infrastructure and provide both viewing and manipulation capabilities for DataFrames managed by the dataframe service tool.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to view all stored DataFrames in a centralized dashboard, so that I can quickly see what data is available and understand its characteristics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to the DataFrames page THEN the system SHALL display a list of all stored DataFrames with their metadata
2. WHEN viewing the DataFrame list THEN the system SHALL show DataFrame ID, creation date, shape, memory usage, and expiration status for each DataFrame
3. WHEN a DataFrame is expired THEN the system SHALL visually indicate its expired status with appropriate styling
4. WHEN I click on a DataFrame entry THEN the system SHALL display detailed metadata including column types, tags, and source information
5. IF no DataFrames are stored THEN the system SHALL display a helpful message with instructions on how to load data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to preview DataFrame contents directly in the web interface, so that I can understand the data structure and content without using command-line tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a DataFrame THEN the system SHALL display a preview of the first 10 rows in a formatted table
2. WHEN viewing DataFrame preview THEN the system SHALL show column names, data types, and handle different data types appropriately
3. WHEN the DataFrame is large THEN the system SHALL provide pagination controls to navigate through the data
4. WHEN displaying data THEN the system SHALL handle null values, long text, and special characters properly
5. WHEN I request a different number of preview rows THEN the system SHALL allow me to specify between 5-100 rows

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to execute pandas operations through a web interface, so that I can manipulate and analyze data without switching to a command-line environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a DataFrame THEN the system SHALL provide a text input for pandas expressions
2. WHEN I enter a valid pandas expression THEN the system SHALL execute it and display the results
3. WHEN the operation returns a DataFrame THEN the system SHALL display it in a formatted table with pagination
4. WHEN the operation returns scalar values THEN the system SHALL display them in an appropriate format
5. WHEN I enter an invalid expression THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with syntax guidance
6. WHEN executing operations THEN the system SHALL show execution time and result metadata

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to perform common DataFrame operations through interactive controls, so that I can analyze data without writing pandas code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a DataFrame THEN the system SHALL provide buttons for common operations (head, tail, describe, info)
2. WHEN I click describe THEN the system SHALL display statistical summaries in a formatted table
3. WHEN I click info THEN the system SHALL show DataFrame information including memory usage and column details
4. WHEN I use filtering controls THEN the system SHALL allow me to filter by column values using dropdown menus and input fields
5. WHEN I apply filters THEN the system SHALL update the display to show only matching rows
6. WHEN I use sorting controls THEN the system SHALL allow me to sort by any column in ascending or descending order

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to manage stored DataFrames through the web interface, so that I can organize and clean up my data workspace efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the DataFrame list THEN the system SHALL provide delete buttons for each DataFrame
2. WHEN I click delete THEN the system SHALL ask for confirmation before removing the DataFrame
3. WHEN I confirm deletion THEN the system SHALL remove the DataFrame and update the list display
4. WHEN I want to load new data THEN the system SHALL provide a form to upload files or specify URLs
5. WHEN uploading data THEN the system SHALL support CSV, JSON, Excel, and Parquet formats
6. WHEN data loading completes THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh the DataFrame list and show the new entry

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to export DataFrame results and visualizations, so that I can share insights and use data in other tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing DataFrame results THEN the system SHALL provide export options for CSV and JSON formats
2. WHEN I click export THEN the system SHALL generate and download the file with appropriate formatting
3. WHEN viewing statistical results THEN the system SHALL provide options to export summary tables
4. WHEN displaying large results THEN the system SHALL allow exporting either the full dataset or current view
5. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL preserve data types and handle special characters correctly

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor DataFrame storage usage and performance, so that I can ensure optimal system performance and resource management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the DataFrames page THEN the system SHALL display overall storage statistics
2. WHEN viewing storage stats THEN the system SHALL show total memory usage, DataFrame count, and available space
3. WHEN DataFrames are approaching expiration THEN the system SHALL highlight them with warning indicators
4. WHEN I request cleanup THEN the system SHALL provide a button to remove all expired DataFrames
5. WHEN cleanup completes THEN the system SHALL show a summary of removed DataFrames and freed memory
