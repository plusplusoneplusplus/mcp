# Sample Test Document

This is a sample document used for integration testing of the knowledge indexer plugin.

## Overview

The knowledge indexer plugin provides functionality for:
- Indexing markdown documents into a vector database
- Performing semantic search on indexed content
- Managing collections of documents
- Persistent storage using ChromaDB

## Technical Details

### Vector Storage
The system uses ChromaDB as the underlying vector database. ChromaDB provides:
- Efficient vector similarity search
- Metadata filtering capabilities
- Persistent storage options
- Collection management

### Embedding Generation
Documents are processed using sentence transformers to generate embeddings:
- Model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2
- Embedding dimension: 384
- Supports both text and table content

## Use Cases

### Document Management
- Upload and index knowledge bases
- Organize content into collections
- Version control through overwrite options

### Search and Retrieval
- Semantic search across documents
- Relevance scoring and ranking
- Metadata-based filtering

## Testing Scenarios

This document is used to test:
1. Document indexing and segmentation
2. Semantic search functionality
3. Collection management operations
4. Persistence across sessions
5. Error handling and recovery

## Performance Considerations

The system is designed to handle:
- Large document collections
- Concurrent access patterns
- Memory-efficient processing
- Fast query response times
