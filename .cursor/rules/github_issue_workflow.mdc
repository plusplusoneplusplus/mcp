# AI Prompt: GitHub Issue Resolution Workflow

## Task Overview

Your primary task is to read a GitHub issue, understand the requirements, implement the necessary changes, create a pull request, and manage the git workflow properly. This is a complete end-to-end workflow for issue resolution.

**Code Editor Context:** Always identify and mention the current code editor being used (e.g., Cursor, Windsurf, VSCode, etc.) in your workflow updates, commit messages, and PR descriptions. This helps provide context for the development environment and any editor-specific features or limitations that may affect the implementation.

## Workflow Steps

### 0. Pre-Work Setup

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Always start by checking out the main branch**
```bash
git checkout main && git pull origin main
```
This ensures you're working from the latest stable code and prevents conflicts.

### 1. Issue Analysis Phase

**Read and Understand the Issue:**
- Carefully read the GitHub issue description, comments, and any attached files
- Identify the problem statement, requirements, and acceptance criteria
- Note any specific implementation details, constraints, or preferences mentioned
- Check for related issues, PRs, or discussions that might provide context
- Identify the scope of changes needed (files, components, features affected)

**Ask Clarifying Questions (if needed):**
- If the issue is unclear or missing critical information, ask specific questions
- Confirm your understanding of the requirements before proceeding
- Verify any assumptions about the implementation approach

### 2. Planning Phase

**Create Implementation Plan:**
- Break down the work into logical steps
- Identify which files need to be modified or created
- Consider the impact on existing functionality
- Plan for testing requirements (unit tests, integration tests, etc.)
- Identify any dependencies or prerequisites

**Branch Management:**
- **First, ensure you're on the main branch with latest changes** (see Pre-Work Setup above)
- Create a new feature branch with a descriptive name (e.g., `fix/issue-123-description` or `feature/issue-456-new-feature`)
- Verify you're working from the latest main branch

### 3. Implementation Phase

**Code Changes:**
- Implement the required changes following the project's coding standards
- Write clean, well-documented code with appropriate comments
- Follow existing patterns and conventions in the codebase
- Ensure backward compatibility unless breaking changes are explicitly required

**Testing:**
- Add or update unit tests for new functionality
- Run existing tests to ensure no regressions
- Add integration tests if applicable
- Test edge cases and error scenarios

**Documentation:**
- Update relevant documentation (README, API docs, etc.)
- Add inline code comments for complex logic
- Update changelog if the project maintains one

### 4. Quality Assurance Phase

**Code Review Preparation:**
- Review your own changes thoroughly
- Check for code quality, performance implications, and security considerations
- Ensure all tests pass
- Verify that the implementation fully addresses the issue requirements

**Commit Management:**
- Make atomic, logical commits with clear commit messages that include the editor name at the end (e.g., "Fix issue #123: Update validation logic (Cursor)")
- Follow the project's commit message conventions
- Include the code editor name at the end of commit messages for development context
- Squash or organize commits if needed for a clean history

### 5. Pull Request Phase

**Create Pull Request:**
- Write a clear, descriptive PR title that references the issue (e.g., "Fix issue #123: Update validation logic")
- Include a comprehensive PR description that:
  - References the original issue (e.g., "Fixes #123" or "Closes #456")
  - Mentions the code editor used for development (e.g., "Developed using Cursor")
  - Summarizes the changes made
  - Explains the approach taken
  - Lists any breaking changes or migration steps
  - Includes testing instructions for reviewers

**PR Best Practices:**
- Add appropriate labels and assignees
- Request reviews from relevant team members
- Include screenshots or demos for UI changes
- Link to any related issues or PRs

### 6. Post-Submission Phase

**Monitor and Respond:**
- Respond promptly to review comments and feedback
- Make requested changes in additional commits or amend existing ones
- Re-request reviews after addressing feedback
- Ensure CI/CD checks pass

**Merge and Cleanup:**
- Once approved, merge the PR using the project's preferred merge strategy
- Delete the feature branch after successful merge
- **Switch back to main branch** and pull latest changes
- Verify the issue is properly closed and linked to the PR

## Git Commands Reference

```bash
# Start workflow - ensure you're on main and up to date
git checkout main && git pull origin main

# Create and switch to feature branch
git checkout -b fix/issue-123-description

# Make commits with editor context
git commit -m "Fix issue #123: Update validation logic (Cursor)"
git commit -m "Add tests for issue #123: Validation improvements (VSCode)"

# After making changes and commits
git push origin fix/issue-123-description

# After PR is merged, cleanup
git checkout main && git pull origin main
git branch -d fix/issue-123-description
git push origin --delete fix/issue-123-description  # if needed
```

## Commit Message Format

Always include the code editor name at the end of your commit messages using this format:
- `Action: Brief description (EditorName)`
- Examples:
  - `Fix issue #123: Update validation logic (Cursor)`
  - `Add feature #456: New user authentication (VSCode)`
  - `Refactor: Improve error handling in API calls (Windsurf)`

## Output Format

When working through this workflow, provide updates at each major step:

- **Issue Number:** #123
- **Problem:** [Brief description]
- **Requirements:** [Key requirements identified]
- **Scope:** [Files/components affected]
- **Approach:** [Planned implementation approach]
```

### Implementation Progress
```markdown

## Best Practices

1. **Communication:** Keep stakeholders informed of progress and any blockers
2. **Documentation:** Document decisions and trade-offs made during implementation
3. **Testing:** Prioritize thorough testing to prevent regressions
4. **Code Quality:** Maintain high code quality standards throughout
5. **Git Hygiene:** Keep commit history clean and meaningful
6. **Branch Management:** Always return to main branch after completion
7. **Issue Tracking:** Ensure proper linking between issues, commits, and PRs

## Error Handling

If you encounter issues during any phase:
- Document the problem clearly
- Seek help or clarification when needed
- Consider alternative approaches if the original plan isn't working
- Update stakeholders on any delays or changes in scope
- Don't hesitate to ask for code review or pair programming assistance

Remember: The goal is not just to close the issue, but to deliver a high-quality solution that improves the codebase and provides value to users.
